His skill set traverses various programming languages, and it led me to believe he has a firm understanding of programming fundamentals and how to leverage that in multiple tech stacks. As a team member I can say that he works very well with others. Heâ€™s always willing to extend a helping hand and responds well to input on his work. Great attitude, positive energy and work ethic. It has been and continues to be great collaborating with Micheal."

He also helped organize the client presentations via workflowy and regular team meetings. While I was struggling with understanding React Hooks he personally hopped on call and helped me sort it out. He was a great coworker and I enjoyed learning and developing alongside him."
